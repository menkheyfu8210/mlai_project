# Shallow-learning methods for pedestrian detection

This repository contains the code for the final project of the Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence course of the Master's Degree in Computer Engineering for Robotics and Smart Industry @UniVR.

## Description

The project explores various shallow-learning techniques for pedestrian classification and detection in images.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies & requirements

The project has the following dependencies:

* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)

The project and dataset require at least 6GB of free disk space.
